# MecrispForth_MS5611
Forth words for ms5611 high resolution pressure sensor on i2c

This was written on an STM32f103, but should run on any STM32 microcontroller.

This is written and tested for Mecrips-Stellaris Forth: http://mecrisp.sourceforge.net/

And I used i2c.fs from Jean-Claude Wippler's flib to simplify the hardware access. https://git.jeelabs.org/jcw/embello/src/branch/master/explore/1608-forth/flib/

Bugs:
 - development currently not finished

Be aware this is very experimental code!
